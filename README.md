# Data Analysis of Covid 19 in the State of California
A look into the number of cases and deaths in the state of California caused by Covid-19

The rmd document contains a brief analysis of the data from the COVID-19 data set from the Johns Hopkins github site. The intention is to provide an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner to ensure the validity of said analysis. In this document we shall import the data and try to analyse the number of cases and deaths in the state of California. Finally we will try to model the deaths by cases and see if they are linearly related.

Please use RStudio to knit the rmd document to reproduce the report.

## Findings


Initial graph of cases and deaths in the state of California through the last year.
